# Steve Refabricated

A Fabric port of the original [Steve mod for Forge](https://github.com/YuvDwi/Steve) by YuvDwi for Minecraft 1.21.1.

Besides the porting, this version also gets .nbt structures from [createmod.com](https://createmod.com/) instead of relying on (very few) server-side structure templates.

## Why?

Because I have a Fabric server with Minecraft 1.21.1 and I wanted to use Steve on it.

As for the choice of getting .nbt files from the internet, it didn't seem very useful to limit the mod to only a few server-side structure templates.
I wanted the AI to act like an AI, so giving it the possibility to look for structures on the internet made more sense. Let the AI hallucinate freely!

_Disclaimer: I never worked with Forge before, so I completely vibe-coded the porting part._
_I should probably be ashamed of myself, but you are looking at a mod to vibe-build your world, so you cannot judge me._
