# Steve Refabricated

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/23f0ccdd-7a7a-4d49-9dd9-215ebf67265a

A Fabric port of the original [Steve mod for Forge](https://github.com/YuvDwi/Steve) by YuvDwi for Minecraft 1.21.1.

## Why?

Because I have a Fabric server with Minecraft 1.21.1 and I wanted to use Steve on it.

_Disclaimer: I never worked with Forge before, so I completely vibe-coded this port._
_I should probably be ashamed of myself, but you are looking at a mod to vibe-build your world, so you cannot judge me._
